Introduction:  
&emsp;This is my Undergraduate Graduation Project. It's a design of the motion planning system with multiple target positions for a mobile robot,using Qt, C++, Theta* algorithm, DWA algorithm.
  
v1.0:  
&emsp;Paint basic widget and implement A* algorithm.  
&emsp;Add main.cpp, widget.cpp, widget.h.  
  
v2.0:  
&emsp;Implement DWA algorithm (basis) and paint a robot to simulate.  
&emsp;Find that A* have some questions(For example: not elastic enough, make DWA simulation be slow)  
&emsp;Add dwa.cpp, dwa.h.  
  
v3.0:  
&emsp;Write hit test and change A* algorithm to Theta* algorithm.  
  
v3.1:  
&emsp;Debug the judge of obstacles.  
  
v3.2:  
&emsp;Debug the hit test.  
  
v4.0:  
&emsp;Set DWA parameter to make the path of simulation be smooth.  
  
v5.0:  
&emsp;Reconstruct DWA algorithm and make the grid size can be changed.  
&emsp;Debug the hit test (find a new bug of hit test qwq~).  
&emsp;Add start.cpp, start.h.  
  
v6.0:  
&emsp;Debug the hit test (why are there so much bugs in hit test qwq~).  
&emsp;Implement page switching.  
&emsp;Add setseo.cpp, setseo.h, setrobot.cpp, setrobot.h, setmoveo.cpp, setmoveo.h.  
&emsp;"Basic opeation" part and "Robot setting" part have finished.  
  
v7.0:
&emsp;Final version.  
&emsp;Debug the hit test.  
&emsp;"Mobile obstacles" part have finished.  
&emsp;Revise the evaluation function of DWA to adaptation dynamic obstacles.
